    "One troubleshooting strategy is to explicitly limit auto-grading to specific notebooks.  For example, for an assignment \"02. Database Basics\", which in its initial form had one nbgrader notebook (`Data_and_database.ipynb`) and lots of other files and folders, and for which some students who struggled create multiple backup copies of this IPython Notebook with different names, all that is fine as long as you use the `--notebook` parameter to tell nbgrader to just grade `Data_and_databases.ipynb`.  \n",
