We use real data used for real world policy problems to analyze some of the vast new sets of data on human beings. We show them how these data can be collected, integrated, and analyzed in a scientific fashion.\r\n\r\nBOOK EDITORS\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIan Foster, University of Chicago\r\nRayid Ghani, University of Chicago\r\nRon Jarmin, U.S. Census Bureau\r\nFrauke Kreuter, University of Maryland\r\nJulia Lane, American Institutes for Research\r\n\r\nWORKBOOK EDITORS\r\n---------\r\n\r\nChristina Jones, Josh Tokle and Ahmad Emad, American Institutes for Research\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWe will incorporate several features that have been successfully used in two classes to federal science agency staff by the proposed chapter authors.\r\n\r\n1. There is a clear conceptual framework that leads naturally to the data structure and to the techniques used (see Figures 1 and 2 below for examples)\r\n2. There is high quality content that incorporates both computer science and social science in all sections of the book\r\n3. The approach combines both research and programming; there is the development of subject matter knowledge, and acknowledgement of the importance of trial and error and experimentation, but a laser like focus on producing high quality statistical output\r\n4. There is an emphasis on coding, but that coding is made as dynamic as possible. As in the classes, we will make use of iPython Notebook (http://ipython.org/notebook.html) so that text, code and mathematics are integrated for classroom use.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n---------\r\n\r\nBig data have brought a new analytical paradigm to statisticians and social scientists (Hey, Tansley, & Tolle, 2009). The research community has moved beyond survey and even administrative data to begin to understand how data can be mined from social media to capture national sentiment, from cellphone data to understand anti-government uprisings, and from financial data to examine swings in the economy.\r\nThe change in paradigm results from changes in many factors that affect the measurement of human behavior: the nature of the new types of data, their availability, the way in which they are collected, and data dissemination. The consequences of these changes for social science research is fundamental change in both the potential analysis that can be done and who the analysts might be. Indeed, while the statistical community has moved beyond survey and even administrative data to begin to understand how data can be mined from social media to capture national sentiment, from cellphone data to understand anti-government uprisings, and from financial data to examine swings in the economy, it is equally important to note that now\r\ndata are freely available and usable to all who want to mash two data series together that are downloaded from the internet – creating an entire new class of citizen, rather than professional, data analysts.\r\nThe change in the nature of the new type of data is transformative. Its characteristics – its velociy, volume and variety – and the way in which it is collected, mean that a new analytical paradigm is open to statisticians and social scientists (Hey et al., 2009). The classic statistical paradigm was one in which researchers formulated a hypothesis, identified a population frame, designed a survey and a sampling technique and then analysed the results(Groves, 2011). The new paradigm means that it is now possible to digitally capture, semantically reconcile, aggregate, and correlate. Those correlations might be effective (Cukier & Schoenberger, 2014; Halevy, Norvig, & Pereira, 2009) or suspect (Couper, 2013). They certainly enable completely new analysis to be undertaken – none of which can be done using survey data alone. For example, the new type of analysis might be one that captures rich environmental detail on individuals (from sensors, google earth, videos, photos or financial transactions). Or the analysis might include rich and detailed information on unique and quite small subsets of the population (from microbiome data, or websearch logs). Or the analysis might be on completely new units of analysis, like networks of individuals or businesses, whose connections can only be captured by new types of data (like tweets, cell phone conversations, and administrative records). As Kahneman points out, the new measurement can change the paradigm in its own right(Kahneman, 2011).\r\nThe change also means a change in the production of social science research. The change in the way in which data are processed and the type of skills that are needed to process the data stems from the fact that the cost of converting data to usable information is very different in a big data world relative to a survey world. One of the most obvious advantages is that electronic data gathering is substantially cheaper than surveys. Surveys are inherently expensive, requiring a good deal of labor to collect the data. In contrast, by relying on computer software, electronic data gathering, while requiring some upfront costs and maintenance costs, can be much more cost effective. But while big data are relatively cheap to collect, they are expensive to clean and process. So the human capital which previously went into designing and sampling now needs to be repurposed into structuring, linking and managing the new types of data.\r\nThe change in the ownership of the data has also transformed the way in which data are disseminated. Data are much less likely to be carefully curated and disseminated by professionals in federally funded statistical agencies or in major survey research organizations. As a result, the population of potential data analysts – trained and untrained has dramatically expanded. This expansion can result in enormous new insights, as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Polymath project has shown (Nielsen, 2012), and is reflected in Grey’s Fourth Paradigm (Figure 1) (Hey et al., 2009), but can also lead to the degradation of the quality of analysis that can be done.\r\nFinally, the excitement of the change in research paradigm should be tempered by a recognition that our existing ways of protecting confidentiality are no longer viable(Karr & Reiter, 2014) As order and analytical rigor is brought to the new data frontier, we should ensure that the future structure of data access ensures that the goal of good science is attained while protecting confidentiality. There is a great deal of research that can be used to inform the development of such a structure, but it has been siloed into separate activities in different research areas - statistics, cybersecurity, cryptography – as well as a variety of different practical applications, including the successful development of remote access secure data enclaves. We must identify ways in which vast new sets of data on human beings can be collected, integrated, and analysed for analysis life while protecting confidentiality(Lane, Stodden, Bender, & Nissenbaum, 2014).\r\n\r\nTextbook and Workbook Outline\r\n1.
